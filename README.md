# Data-Integration-Practicum-Terminator-Prediction
* GetData contains Raw data and preprocessing scipt
* TargetSequence contains processed sequence data with 400 bases around termination site(300 upstream, 100 downstream). Each file has 50 bases in target region of all termination sites --- "Sec1.fasta" has first 50,"Sec2.fasta" has second 50..etc.
